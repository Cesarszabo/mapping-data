Coursera Lesson 2: Mapping Data to Python


Fork the Github repository and create a new Jupyter Notebook.

Load the CSV file in the notebook from your forked repository.

Use a distinct field to retrieve data, like:

Type of wine (red or white)

Wine score range or baseline (e.g. between 90 and 92 points)

Region

Capture every row that matches your condition, and after processing, save everything to a formatted new JSON file

Create a Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.

Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.
